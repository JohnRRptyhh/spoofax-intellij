## Design
Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific languages, and this is represented in the logo by the curly brackets most programmers are familiar with. The typeface is [_Kadwa_](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Kadwa), an open-source font. The font was chosen to have monospace characteristics, yet be distinctive. The `S` in the logo is the same color as the default color for keywords in Spoofax editors, which is color `#8A2064` (RGB: 138, 33, 100). The other characters are pure black.

The `{S}` part is also used as an icon for Spoofax projects.
