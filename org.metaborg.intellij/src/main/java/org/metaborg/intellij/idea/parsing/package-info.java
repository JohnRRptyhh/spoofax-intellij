/**
 * Parsing functionality.
 *
 * IntelliJ IDEA uses three concepts for parsing: the highlighter, the lexer and the
 * parser.
 *
 * The highlighter is an incremental lexer, and IntelliJ IDEA will call upon it for syntax
 * highlighting. It may ask the highlighter to highlight only a subsection of the source file,
 * usually only the part that's most likely to change due to user actions such as typing.
 * The {@link org.metaborg.intellij.idea.parsing.SpoofaxHighlightingLexer} class is the
 * highlighting lexer for Spoofax languages.
 *
 * Under the hood IntelliJ IDEA builds an in-memory representation of each source file.
 * It does this by invoking the lexer on the whole file, and then the parser on the
 * tokens returned by the lexer to construct a PSI tree from it.  For a source file the
 * PSI tree is similar to an AST, but in IntelliJ IDEA the PSI elements are also used
 * to describe things other than syntax, such as the source files themselves
 * ({@link com.intellij.psi.PsiFile}).
 *
 * For Spoofax languages we use the {@link CharacterLexer} class as the lexer. It simply
 * returns each character in the source as a token, as the SGLR parser works on characters
 * and has no actual lexer. There is no actual parser implemented for Spoofax languages,
 * as the IntelliJ IDEA framework for parsers is too limited. Instead, we override the
 * {@link com.intellij.psi.tree.IFileElementType#doParseContents} method and do the
 * parsing ourselves.
 *
