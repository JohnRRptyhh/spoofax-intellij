This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## Git

This project uses the Git layout described in the article [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by Vincent Driessen.

The latest release of this project can be found in the `master` branch, tagged with the release version. The latest nightly can be found in the `develop` branch. Features are added only to the `develop` branch, whereas hotfixes are added to both the `develop` branch and the `master` branch (which in turn results in a new release).
