/**
 * JPS plugin with Metaborg Core functionality.
 * <p>
 * The JetBrains Project System (JPS) build system is used to build
 * an IntelliJ project. When an IntelliJ project is being build (e.g. by
 * clicking <em>Make Project</em> from the <em>Build</em> menu), a new
 * process is created in which the JPS plugin is loaded.
 * <p>
 * The JPS plugin is registered with the IDEA plugin in the
 * <a href="META-INF.plugin.xml">plugin.xml</a> file under the
 * &lt;compileServer.plugin&gt; tag. All the JPS plugin's dependencies
 * are listed there as well. You can get a list of JPS plugin dependencies
 * by executing the <code>gradle printJpsDependencies</code> task in the
 * project root.
 * <p>
 * The JPS plugin exposes services, which are
 * loaded by the build system through the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} class.
